making some dev notes ...

# Membot Apps

## Notes
Logs any string of text, which can be categorized and retrieved by hashtag. Useful for tucking away otherwise transient ideas.

**Note model**
* timestamp of creation
* text
* person who created it
* category

**Creation:** In Slack, "membot we should consider csvkit for a #codeconvening"

**Retrieval:** In Slack, "membot please show me #codeconvening"

**Reminders:** I'm thinking a Monday morning email to everyone in the group, with a catalog of all the notes that have been added in the past week.

**Commands**

"membot please show me #codeconvening"
"membot please show me #codeconvening since 3/12"
"membot please list hashtags/categories"

## Reminders
Logs a string of text, and then sends an email reminder to the user who created it on a specified date.

**Reminder model**
* timestamp of creation
* text
* person who created it
* category

**Creation:** In Slack, "membot remind me to revise the fellowship questions on 3/12/2015"

**Notes:** The date parsing should attempt to be smart about many types of input: "on Monday," "on March 12" (should know whether that's next year), "on 3/12," etc.

## People
Stores contact information and notes about people in the community we want to keep track of. A little rolodex for things like "this person is kind of badass, we should keep them in mind for XXX."

**Person model**
* first name
* last name
* twitter handle
* github handle
* email address
* where they work
* notes

**Creation:** Likely via admin interface rather than Slack

**Retrieval:** Searchable index on the membot site. Maybe a Slack option that searches name/notes, retrieves link to detail page on membot site? "membot please show me people like XXXX"

## Groups
Stores contact information about groups we want to keep track of.

**Group model**
* name
* location
* website
* email address

**Creation:** Likely via admin interface rather than Slack

**Retrieval:** Searchable index on the membot site. Maybe a Slack option that searches by name, retrieves link to detail page on membot site?

## Major Events
Stores information about major events (e.g. conference level, not recurring local events) that we want to keep track of.

**Major Event model**
* name
* location
* start date
* registration deadline
* submission deadline (e.g. for conference proposals)
* website

**Creation:** Likely via admin interface rather than Slack

**Retrieval:** Searchable index on the membot site. A Slack command could search by name and retrieve link to detail page on membot site. "membot please show me events like XXXX"

**Reminders:** This app should send out automatic reminders each time a date field is drawing near. I'm thinking a weekly trigger (maybe on Mondays?) that collects event with a submission deadline, registration deadline, or start date in the next 30 days.

Down the road, Major Event data could be also used to trigger reminders to people based on locale.

## Templates
Stores big chunks of text that we might want to reference down the road. Imagine coming up on MozFest and going "membot please show templates for mozfest emails."

**Template model**
* name
* text

**Creation:** Via admin interface

**Retrieval:** Searchable index on the membot site. A Slack command could search by name and retrieve link to detail page on membot site. "membot please show templates for XXXX"

## Messages
Defines automatic emails to send, using data from other Membot apps.
